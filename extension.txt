Extension.cpp will determine if two people can be linked through their shared
friends. The number of pairs represent friends, and is saved into the set of
data. Extension.cpp uses a graph with hashmap (unordered_map) where the friend
has a number as the key, along with a pointer to the friend. DFS search is then
used to locate the destination (end friend), once all friends have been loaded
. Traversing the graph will proceed to the next height of the graph to 
determine the number of links from searching. Tests were conducted using data 
that is available online. A smaller data set was used. Number of friends is
provided using depth first search. Output includes number of links (or 
connections) indicating there are that many friends (or less). This indicates
that there is a connection between the two people. File to read in include 
data.tsv, and file of pairs to compute include compute.tsv. Below is how to 
run the program:

./extension file_to_read file_of_pairs output_file
